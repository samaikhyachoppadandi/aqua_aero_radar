# Aqua Aero Radar
Air and Water quality testing using arudino

Instrumented a device for diagnosing the quality of air and water and impacts of air pollution on water using Arduino, an open-source platform. Used Thing Speak cloud platform to store the data collected from different sensors at various locations. Applied Supervised learning algorithms to study the quality of water and learnt the measures to overcome water contamination.
